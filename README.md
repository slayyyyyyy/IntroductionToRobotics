# IntroductionToRobotics (2023-2024)

Made for my 3rd year Robotics course at University of Bucharest. This repository contains weekly uploads of homework and labwork to track my personal growth and (maybe) some personal projects as well. Along with the code, requirements and implementation details, it also contains pictures as proof of the physical work from behind the curtains. Working in Arduino IDE with Kuongshun's learning kit.

End goal: building a real life BMO :)

## Homework 1

Had to create the github repository and give access to our teacher and TAs. 

## Homework 2

Component requirements: <br />
• RGB LED (At least 1) <br />
• Potentiometers (At least 3) <br />
• Resistors and wires as needed <br />

Tasks: <br />
• Technical Task : Use of separate potentiometers for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, I need to read the potentiometer’s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins. <br />
• Publishing Task : Update github repo with the code and update README.md with the task requirements, pics of the setup and a link to a video showing its functionality. <br />
• Coding Task : Clean, well-structured code, avoidance of "magic numbers", use of constants with meaningful names. <br />

Using 3 potentiometers, a RGB LED, 3 resistors and a whole bunch of wires, I finally put together the following setup:

Using the 3 potentiometers, one can control and adjust the brightness of each LED color. The video accessed through this Google Drive link will show a demonstration of what the circuit and the code provided in the repository do: [RGB control with 3 potentiometers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dxou-CeesZ6c_ggzSLRYmoL9Te8A52zk/view?usp=share_link)

Fun and easy task :) !
