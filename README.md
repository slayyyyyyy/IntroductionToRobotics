# IntroductionToRobotics (2023-2024)

Made for my 3rd year Robotics course at University of Bucharest. This repository contains weekly uploads of homework and labwork to track my personal growth and (maybe) some personal projects as well. Along with the code, requirements and implementation details, it also contains pictures as proof of the physical work from behind the curtains. Working in Arduino IDE with Kuongshun's learning kit.

End goal: building a real life BMO :)
