# IntroductionToRobotics

Made for my 3rd year Robotics course at University of Bucharest. This repository will contain weekly uploads with homework and labwork to track my personal growth and maybe some personal projects as well. Will contain pictures as proof of the physical work as well. Working in Arduino IDE with Kuongshun's learning kit.

End goal: building a real life BMO.
